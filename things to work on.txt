Known Issues
- Vertex drawing on Catalan tilings.
- Coloring on rectifieds.
- Iterating to starting point doesn't always converge, which could cause missed tweets.
- “vertex-centered” can we make orientation better?
- centering not reported correctly on Mercator projection.
- Mobius transforms can get out-of-sync with model in Euclidean case. Could make this safer.

Work Debt
- Publish R3.Core on Nuget: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package-using-visual-studio

Tiling ideas
- prisms/antiprism
- Circles that are in-circles of the F.D.
- Animations
- Leverage the list of reflections to color cosets (e.g. like in MagicTile).
- Non-triangular domains (see FB thread with Tom).
- Links to wiki pages (would require ensuring redirect links for wiki pages existed).
- Include non-uniform choices (i.e. pick a random point or line in fundamental domain)
- stellations
- triaxial weave
- https://mathblog.com/tiling-one-arc-sided-shape
- circles emanating from F.D. verts., like MagicTile
- support tilings I've emailed myself
- support for "mosaic" tilings, i.e. subdivide F.D. into Vornoi cells.
- additional operations, e.g. truncating snubs (which make them non-uniform)
- line-like drawimgs https://twitter.com/rafaela31416/status/1019520934724689920

Feature Ideas
- support custom tweet strings, and maybe specialized code for "requested by"
- Add in well-known descriptions for platonic solids, etc.
- SVG output
- disk model with hyperbolas? (I experimented some with this).
- pictures (cats on caturday?)
- constant width lines

Variability Ideas or Improvement
- Allow applying a circle inversion.
- Too many 3s in random selection
- Bounds
- B&W coloring option
- More than one uniform on a single tiling? Or uniform + dual on same tiling.
- Other decorations (e.g. set of random points inside fundamental domain)
- Better colors. Why do reds seem to rarely get picked? More color functions. Same saturation/intensity for all color choices?

Research Ideas:
- Johnson solid analogue in hyperbolic plane?
- non-repeating tiling with infinite number of tiles possible? Or maybe just tilings that transition between different tilings, say from {7,3} to 14-gons.
- How do {5,3} and {7,3} interact on same image? (orthographic projections)
